# Decision & issue log

A running record of **why** the project looks the way it does: technical decisions, and the issues found
along the way. Newest entries go at the bottom of each list.

- **Don't rewrite history.** When a decision changes, add a new entry and mark the old one
  `Superseded by D-xxx`. When an issue is fixed, change its status and add how.
- **Status values.** Decisions: `Accepted` (agreed, or already built) · `Proposed` (in the plan, not yet
  agreed or built) · `Superseded`. Issues: `Open` · `Workaround` · `Resolved`.
- Keep entries short. Link commits, docs and files instead of repeating them.

### D-001
**Keep YOLOE-seg (not OWLv2 + SAM2).** One `ultralytics` model gives box + mask in a single pass and was
already working end to end. OWLv2 + SAM2 means two chained models, ~2× latency, and glue work, for a
mask-quality gain that only matters if grasping turns out to need it.
*Revisit only if* YOLOE masks block pose/grasp on hard objects (transparent, reflective, thin).

### D-002
**Standalone vision first.** The earlier ROS 2 / Isaac Sim stack was removed (`e5e8710`) to build and
understand each stage on real RGB-D frames without ROS or a simulator (stages 1–5, `docs/STAGE*.md`).
The old ROS packages (Humble, Python) are still in git history: reference only.

### D-003
**Stage 1 on the host.** YOLOE runs from the host `.venv` (`1e7f05a`). FoundationPose stays in its Docker
container because of its custom CUDA extensions.

### D-004
**Isaac Sim 6.1 in `.venv-sim`.** `pip install "isaacsim[all,extscache]==6.1.0.0"` (Python 3.12, ~25 GB),
separate from the vision `.venv`. Guide: [SIM.md](SIM.md).

### D-005
**Sim datasets = FoundationPose layout + ground truth.** `data/sim/scene/` holds shared RGB-D,
`data/sim/<target>/` holds per-target masks and `ob_in_cam` poses, and `T_base_cam.txt` holds the
extrinsics. The sim converts the **same** `assets/ycb/<obj>/textured.obj` that FoundationPose loads, so
ground truth and estimates share one object frame. Stage 2 reports error vs ground truth via `--data`.

### D-006
**Livestream is view-only.** With WebRTC streaming on, Replicator never returns data (see
[I-002](#i-002)), so `--livestream` shows the scene and saves nothing. Capture runs separately (it can
run at the same time).

### D-007
**Fixed camera.** Rendered as NVIDIA's RealSense **D455** model on a visual-only floor tripod; the colour
lens sits on the optical centre and the rig never appears in its own images. Intrinsics stay at
**fx = 615 (D435 colour)** rather than the D455's real ~320 at 640×480, which would halve the objects in
the image. Moved from 1.05 m to **~0.73 m** from the targets (twice the pixels on the bottle).

### D-008
**Demo picks: mustard (upright) + tomato can lying on its side.** The lying can was tested: it rocks
~7 mm onto a flat of its collision hull in the first 2 s, then stays put (20 s, every yaw). So we kept
the tomato can rather than falling back to the potted meat can (which can't roll).
FoundationPose on the lying can: 0.6–1.1°, < 1 mm (sim, ground-truth mask).

### D-009
**Shelf = place target; wrist camera for it.** Open shelf 90° to the robot's right, 3 levels
(0 / 0.32 / 0.64 m), all within reach (0.6–0.81 m from the shoulder). The shelf is seen by an
**eye-in-hand wrist camera** from a fixed "look at the shelf" arm pose (`cd5338a`), which feeds stage 5
placement (`7ef4cc5`, [STAGE5_PLACE.md](STAGE5_PLACE.md)). Stage 5 uses no shelf model: any horizontal
surface the camera sees is a candidate support.

### D-010
**ROS 2 Jazzy integration, no cheating.** Each vision stage becomes a node. The pipeline may only use
what a real robot would have:

| Allowed into the pipeline | Source |
|---|---|
| Camera images: RGB, aligned depth (`16UC1` mm), `camera_info`, with RealSense-style topic names | Isaac camera publishers |
| `/joint_states`, `/clock` | ros2_control inside Isaac |
| Robot model → TF | `moveit_resources_panda_description` |
| Camera extrinsics (fixed + wrist) | Calibration files (see [I-018](#i-018)) |
| Table / shelf collision boxes for MoveIt | `config.yaml` (measured once, as in a real cell) |
| What to pick | A prompt (example image or text) |

**Never** into the pipeline: `/sim/gt/*` (object poses, true extrinsics) and `/sim/reset`. Only
`eval_node` and test harnesses use them. A launch test will fail if any pipeline node subscribes to
`/sim/gt/*`.

### D-011
**Python vision nodes; C++ RANSAC.** ML stages (YOLOE, and the parts of FoundationPose we own) stay
Python around the tested `vision/` code. Stage 3's table-plane RANSAC + occupancy grid becomes a C++ node
(Eigen), checked against the Python version on the same recorded frames. If that turns out not to be
simple, it stays Python. Open: [Q-001](#q-001).

### D-012
**Isaac ROS FoundationPose, pinned to 4.5.** It's cleaner than rebuilding the FoundationPose container
for Jazzy (Python 3.8 → 3.12, [I-009](#i-009)), and it's C++/TensorRT. Version choice:

| Isaac ROS | ROS 2 | Needs | Fits this machine (driver 580, CUDA 13.0)? |
|---|---|---|---|
| 5.0 (2026-09-21) | Lyrical | driver 595+, CUDA 13.2+ | ✗ wrong ROS distro |
| 4.6 | Jazzy | driver 595+, CUDA 13.2+ | ✗ needs a driver upgrade |
| **4.5** | Jazzy | driver 580+, CUDA 13.0+ | **✓** |

Runs in NVIDIA's Isaac ROS container (`--network host`); models from NGC (ONNX → `trtexec` → `.plan`,
FP32 only). ~7 GB GPU per instance.

### D-013
**Panda.** Matches Isaac's Franka asset and the apt MoveIt config (`moveit_resources_panda_*`). No FR3:
this is a demonstration, not a deployment.

### D-014
**BehaviorTree.CPP v4** (apt: `ros-jazzy-behaviortree-cpp` 4.10) for the task manager, in C++.

### D-015
**ros2_control inside Isaac Sim** (`isaacsim.ros2.control`, 6.1, Jazzy build included): a standard
`controller_manager` runs in-process on the Panda articulation. MoveIt → `joint_trajectory_controller` →
sim is the same chain a real robot would use; only the hardware plugin differs.

### D-016
**Request-driven perception; one FoundationPose per target.** Isaac ROS FoundationPose takes one mesh per
node instance and runs on every mask it receives, so: two instances (mustard, tomato), and `detect_node`
publishes a mask only when the behavior tree asks for an object. `detect_node` re-publishes the exact
RGB / depth / `camera_info` it detected on, with the mask, so FoundationPose's time-synced inputs always
match.

### D-017
**Foxglove for viewing.** `foxglove_bridge` on the workstation, Foxglove on the laptop. RViz needs a
local display, and the WebRTC stream can't run alongside ROS cameras ([I-013](#i-013)).

### D-018
**This log lives in the repo**, versioned with the code it explains.

### D-019
**One C++ RANSAC, used by stages 3 and 5.** Resolves [Q-001](#q-001). In Python they already share
`spatial.fit_plane_ransac()` (stage 5's `place.find_planes()` calls it repeatedly to peel off one
horizontal plane after another). The C++ version keeps that shape:

| Piece | What |
|---|---|
| `ppp_geometry` (C++ library, Eigen) | `fit_plane_ransac()` (largest plane within a tilt of "up", then least-squares refit) + `find_planes()` (sequential RANSAC) |
| `spatial_node` (C++, stage 3) | Links the library directly |
| `place_node` (Python, stage 5) | Calls the same code through a **pybind11** module; the rest of stage 5 stays Python (D-011) |
| `vision/` (offline playgrounds) | Can switch to the binding too, so offline and ROS results come from one implementation |

**Testing:** C++ and numpy draw different random samples, so compare *results*, not bits: plane normal
within 0.5°, offset within 2 mm, inlier count within 1%, on recorded sim frames of the table and shelf.

### D-020
**Stage 5 in the ROS plan.** Resolves [Q-002](#q-002). Add `place_node` (Python): wrist-camera RGB-D +
`T_base_cam` from TF (forward kinematics + wrist hand-eye calibration) → supports → place candidates, as
a `GetPlacements` service. The behavior tree gains a step before placing: move to the "look at the
shelf" joint pose (`sim.wrist_camera.look_joints`), capture, ask `place_node`, then place at the best
reachable candidate.

### D-021
**Shelf items are never pick targets.** Resolves [I-014](#i-014). The tomato can on shelf level 1 became
a **foam brick**. Neither option (swap vs. a table-area filter in `detect_node`) costs GPU or RAM:
FoundationPose instances exist only for the targets, and YOLOE's cost doesn't depend on how many objects
are in view. The swap wins because it removes the ambiguity instead of adding filter logic, and the
shelf item's pose is never needed. Stage 5 results are unchanged (same 7 supports, middle level still
best with 125 mm of room, 8 candidates).

### D-022
**Isaac ROS 4.5 FoundationPose image** (`docker/Dockerfile.isaac_ros`, resolves [I-011](#i-011)). NGC has one Jazzy
base image (CUDA 13.0, TensorRT 10.13, driver 580+); its apt source is switched from `release-4.0` to `release-4.5`
and `ros-jazzy-isaac-ros-foundationpose` installed at build time, where the NVIDIA runtime's GL/EGL bind mounts
don't exist yet. 4.5's pip-shim packages refuse to install until `isaac-ros-cli` names the environment, so
`/etc/isaac-ros-cli/environment.conf` says `docker-activated`, as NVIDIA's own container layer does.
`docker/foundationpose.sh` builds the engines once and runs one namespaced pipeline per target (`/ppp/fp/<target>`)
as the host user, with host network + IPC (DDS shared memory with host processes).

### D-023
**Look before you pick** (`SelectPlans` in `ppp_task`). The grasp has to suit the place as well as the pick: a
top-down grasp can't put the 19 cm mustard bottle into a 30 cm shelf gap (no room for the wrist above it) nor onto
the top board (flange out of reach). So the arm looks at the shelf *before* picking, and each placement (best
clearance first) × grasp (least tilted first) is checked: pregrasp, grasp, lift, preplace, place must all have a
collision-free IK solution (MoveIt `/compute_ik`, held mesh attached from the lift on). Motions between them are
only planned when executed; a failed motion moves on to the next plan. Supersedes the order in D-020.

### D-024
**Place in the table rest pose.** The object goes down oriented as it stood on the table (a pose known to be
stable), turned about vertical only. A side grasp (approach > 30° from vertical) is turned so it points from the
robot towards the place point, i.e. into the shelf. The ROS `grasp_node` allows approaches up to 95° from vertical
(the playground keeps 50°): without side grasps the bottle can't go into the shelf at all.

### D-025
**Visual prompt + text check** (`detect_node`, `prompt: visual+text`). Measured on the live sim: the visual prompt
alone picks the right tomato can in 7/12 and 9/12 random scenes; the potted meat can looks alike. Each visual
detection is now checked by a text-prompt YOLOE with the target's name + a generic vocabulary (config.yaml
`detect.vocabulary`, no scene-specific names): score = visual + text(target) − text(best other name) on the same
mask. Over 24 scenes, threshold −0.25: 20 accepted, all right; the 4 rejected were all wrong detections. A rejection
fails the task honestly instead of picking the wrong object. Costs one more YOLOE pass (~40 ms).

### D-026
**Sim drives closer to a real Franka** (config.yaml `sim.arm_drive`, `sim.gripper`). franka.usd's arm damping
(80 N·m·s/deg vs stiffness 400 N·m/deg: 0.2 s time constant) made the arm trail a moving trajectory by 25–45 mm;
damping 10 → 0.2–7 mm. The finger drive was capped at 7.2 N and the bottle slipped out while the arm moved
(the task first reported it placed, ground truth had it on the table): 70 N (a real Franka Hand's continuous force)
and friction 1.0 on the finger pads.

### D-027
**Planning scene.** Fixed: table, pedestal, shelf panels + boards, floor (`planning_scene.py`, from config.yaml, as
D-010 allows). Per perception: the points standing on the table's footprint minus the target, as 2.5 cm voxel boxes
(`UpdateScene`) - without them the arm knocked the bottle over while moving between pregrasps of different plans.
The target's mesh joins while the arm travels to it (`AddTarget`) and leaves right before the fingers close around
it (`RemoveTarget`); from the lift it is attached to the hand. The task manager clears its own objects at start.

### D-028
**Symmetric objects.** config.yaml `objects.<name>.symmetry_axis` (the tomato can: z). FoundationPose's roll about
that axis is arbitrary (a live estimate came back 121° off, and the box grasp model then had no face pointing up:
0/16 grasps); `grasp_node` also tries the box model turned about the axis every 15°.

### D-029
**Python nodes on the `.venv`** (resolves [I-012](#i-012)). With Jazzy sourced, the `.venv`'s Python 3.12 imports
`rclpy` and the generated messages fine; no separate venv. Launch files run the nodes with `.venv/bin/python` as
prefix. The pybind11 module is built with the `.venv`'s pybind11 (I-022); `ros2/build.sh` does both.

### D-030
**Recovery never drops an object somewhere random.** After a failed pick-and-place the `Recover` tree puts a still
held object back where it was picked; if that fails, it keeps holding it and goes home. (First version opened the
gripper wherever the arm was, and the bottle fell into the shelf.) The BT also re-checks the grasp after the lift
and before releasing, so a dropped object is never reported as placed.

### D-031
**Upright first, on its side if that is what fits** (`vision/place.py rest_poses`, `place_node`, `SelectPlans`).
Keeping the table pose (D-024) stored the tomato can lying down, which a person wouldn't do. Now the object's stable
rest poses come from its mesh: each face of the convex hull whose support polygon holds the centre of mass, at
least 2.8 cm wide (narrower = a curved surface on one facet of the tessellated hull, e.g. a can on its side, which
rolls), never upside down. YCB meshes are modelled upright, so poses are ranked upright first, then on a side by
stability margin. Stage 5 returns placements per rest pose (its own footprint and headroom); `SelectPlans` tries them
in that order with the grasp from the table (same grasp in the object frame, the wrist does the turning), picking
the yaw that points a side grasp into the shelf, else trying quarter turns. Result: the lying can is stood upright;
a bottle too tall for the free space would be laid down. Possible later: a VLM prior for which poses are acceptable
for unfamiliar objects (e.g. keep containers of liquid upright).

### D-032
**`ros_cell.py --livestream`** enables `omni.kit.livestream.app` as in `scene.py`, so the live cell can be
watched in the Isaac Sim WebRTC Streaming Client while the whole ROS pipeline runs (I-013 turned out not to
apply). Foxglove (D-017) stays the way to see ROS data: detections, planned paths, TF.

### D-033
**Re-lay out the cell for clearance.** Motions in the live run look contorted, and the 8-episode baseline is can
6/8, mustard 3/8. Suspected causes in the current layout (`config.yaml` `sim:`):
- The table's near edge is 0.20 m from the base, and objects sit 0.33–0.72 m out. Top-down grasps close to the base
  fold joint 4 hard.
- The shelf is 0.43 m to the side (near edge) at board heights 0 / 0.32 / 0.64 m. The low board is cramped under
  the arm, and the top one is near the reach limit once the hand is inside the shelf.
- Table → shelf is a 90° swing of joint 1 with the object held low, next to the table.

Plan: (1) log which motions fail or wind up in the baseline (`sim/episodes.py -n 10`); (2) move the table and
objects about 0.10 m further out, and the shelf to about 0.5–0.6 m from the base, possibly angled towards the
table; (3) regenerate what depends on the layout: `config/calibration.yaml` (`sim/write_calibration.py`),
`look_joints` (IK), the overview camera and figures; (4) re-run 10 episodes and compare.

### D-034
**Overlay of the current target in the sim viewport** (`ros_cell.py`, `isaacsim.util.debug_draw`, so it shows in the
WebRTC stream too). Magenta: the object's box and axes at `/pose_node/pose`. Dim green: `/place_node/placements`
candidates. Green: the object's box where the task will set it down (`/task_manager/place_goal`, published when a
plan is taken). `/task_manager/target` (latched) announces each target and is set to "" when done, which clears the
overlay. With no target announced, a pose is matched to the nearest sim object. Viewer only.

### D-035
**Cell layout from the Panda's reach** (supersedes the plan in D-033; config.yaml `sim:`, `robot:`). An IK scan of the
Panda: top-down grasps have good joint margins 0.5–0.72 m from the base (at 0.3–0.4 m joint 4 folds up), horizontal
placements with the hand 0.1–0.6 m high. So:

| | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| Table | near edge 0.20 m, objects 0.33–0.72 m out | near edge 0.35 m, targets 0.55–0.66 m out |
| Shelf | 0.60 × 0.30 m, boards 0 / 0.32 / 0.64 m, 3 cm from the table corner | 0.80 × 0.35 m, boards 0.05 / 0.45 m (0.38 m gap, open top), 15 cm from the table |
| Home | facing the table (joint 1 at 0) | facing between table and shelf (joint 1 at −45°) |

The L-shape stays (table in front, shelf on the right). Rotating home by 45° is kinematically the same as rotating the
pedestal (joint 1 has ±166°), and keeps base = world for calibration, planning scene and ground truth. The pedestal
(20 cm, the Panda's own footprint) is a static collider, so its size and mass don't matter. The potted meat can left the
scene: from the new camera position YOLOE took it for the tomato can in both runs (I-025).

### D-036
**Longer fingers, stronger squeeze** (`gripper.finger_extension`, `sim.gripper`). Each finger continues 5 cm past its
tip as a box, pad face flush with the stock pad, in the sim (`sim/cell.py`) and in MoveIt's robot model
(`ppp_bringup/launch/common.py`): TCP 0.1034 → 0.1534 m from the hand. The hand stays further from the object and the
shelf, and grasps reach deeper (`gripper.finger_depth` 3 → 4.5 cm; at 3 cm a side grasp held the mustard by its
thin edge and it slipped). The finger drive squeezes with up to 140 N (a real Franka Hand's peak; 70 N continuous),
stiffness 6000 N/m. Under that load the mimic finger drifts: the task measures the grip as the sum of both fingers,
and the articulation runs 64 solver iterations. A different hand (e.g. Robotiq 2F-140) was not needed.

### D-037
**Clean motions** (`ppp_task`, `launch/common.py`). The arm swung through odd configurations because MoveIt's default
IK (KDL) restarts from random joint values: for one pregrasp it returned configurations 6–13 rad (summed over the
joints) from home, while a natural one is 3.3 rad away (I-032). Now:

| Piece | What |
|---|---|
| IK | **pick_ik** (global, least displacement from the seed): the solution nearest the seed |
| Chained IK | `SelectPlans` seeds each pose with the one before (home → pregrasp → grasp → lift → preplace → place), joint 1 turned towards free-space goals; straight-line steps may not move any joint more than 0.8 rad |
| Joint targets | Free-space moves go to those joint solutions, not to poses, so the planner can't choose another configuration |
| Planner order | Straight line in joint space (Pilz PTP) → two straight lines through home → OMPL |
| Collision checks | Straight lines checked every 0.02 rad against the planning scene (Pilz alone checks too sparsely for 2 cm boards); OMPL's segment check 10× finer than default |
| Held object | Attached to the hand as its mesh padded by 5 mm, so every IK, plan and check includes it (the dynamic form of adding it to the URDF) |
| Standoffs | Pregrasp 6 → 10 cm, preplace 10 → 12 cm, lift 12 → 18 cm: the straight lines arrive without sweeping the fingers through the object or a board |

Result: moves of 2.6–5 rad as straight joint-space lines; ~10 rad via home when the direct line would sweep the held
object through the shelf (before: OMPL detours of 10–15 rad). Of 97 free-space moves in 10 episodes, 75 were one
straight line, 13 went via home, 9 needed OMPL.

| 10 randomised episodes (`sim/episodes.py`) | Before (8 episodes, D-033) | After (D-035–D-037) |
|---|---|---|
| Mustard bottle placed | 3/8 | **10/10** |
| Tomato can placed (stood upright) | 6/8 | **8/10** |
| Task verdict = ground truth | 13/16 | 19/20 |

The two can failures: not detected (I-025), and released on the top board's end but found off the shelf (I-037).

### D-038
**Only the necessary safety logic** (`trees/pick_and_place.xml`, `bt_nodes.cpp`). Removed: re-trying other placements
with the object in hand, the grasp check right after closing (the one after the lift covers it), IK failure
diagnostics, the trace logger, the `pose_service` stub hook, the table-rest-pose placement mode. Kept, because each
fixed a real failure: grasp check after the lift and before release (D-030: no false "placed"), `Recover` putting a
held object back (D-030), waiting for the arm to settle before planning (I-028), start-state clamping (I-028), the gripper's
position-based stall (I-019), refusing a second sim (I-030), planning-scene cleanup before every target.

### D-039
**Vision reliability: detect in the vision nodes, decide in the behavior tree** (proposed). The checks need the
images and models, so they belong where those are; what to do about a failure (look again from another angle, try
another plan, give up) needs the task's context, so it belongs in the tree. Each vision service already returns
`success` + a message; add a confidence and the reason:

| Where | Check | Cheap? |
|---|---|---|
| `detect_node` | Mask big enough, most mask pixels have depth, visual + text score margin (D-025) | yes |
| `pose_node` | The estimate agrees with the data: object bottom on the table plane (±2 cm), rendered silhouette vs mask IoU | yes / medium |
| `pose_node` | Two estimates from consecutive frames agree (rotation < 5°, 5 mm) | one more FoundationPose pass |
| `place_node` | At least one support at a plausible height; placements inside the wrist camera's view | yes |
| Behavior tree | On a vision failure: re-detect once after a short wait, then look from a second camera pose, then skip the target | — |

### D-040
**Shelf distance and STOMP.** Asked to move the robot 30–50 cm further from the shelf and to consider RRT / CHOMP /
STOMP. An IK scan (no collisions) keeps 85–100 % of shelf spots reachable up to +0.2 m, ~55 % at +0.3 m and almost none at
+0.4–0.5 m, so +0.2 and +0.1 m were tried, 10 randomised episodes each:

| Shelf front from the base | Free-space planners, in order | Mustard | Tomato can |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0.47 m (D-035) | PTP → via home → OMPL RRTConnect | **10/10** | **8/10** |
| 0.67 m | PTP → STOMP → RRTConnect | 5/10 | 5/10 |
| 0.67 m | PTP → via home → STOMP → RRTConnect | 2/10 | 7/10 |
| 0.57 m | PTP → via home → STOMP → RRTConnect | 3/4 | 2/4 (stopped after 4) |

Further away, the tall bottle's placements drop out of comfortable reach (5 of 10 runs found no reachable grasp +
placement pair) and carrying into the shelf clips the board edges. **The shelf stays at 0.47 m.** STOMP alone can't
replace "via home": it only bends the direct line locally, and 7 carries found no plan without the detour through
home. So the order is PTP → via home → STOMP → RRTConnect: straight line, straight lines through a hub pose, an
optimizer, a sampler. RRTConnect is OMPL's bidirectional RRT. CHOMP was not added: like STOMP it optimizes the direct
line, but needs a distance field of the scene. The four-planner order has not yet been re-measured at 0.47 m.

### D-041
**Metal pantry and a long, narrow table** (config.yaml `sim:`; boxes shared by the sim and MoveIt: `vision.shelf_boxes`).

| | Before (D-035) | After |
|---|---|---|
| Shelf | 2 boards (0.05 / 0.45 m), side and back panels, open top | Pantry 2.05 m tall: 4 corner posts, boards at −0.35 / 0.05 / 0.45 / 0.95 / 1.30 m, open back and sides, steel material |
| Table | 0.55 × 0.80 m (x 0.35–0.90) | 0.40 × 0.95 m (x 0.40–0.80, y −0.30–0.65) |
| Items | targets 0.55–0.66 m out | same distances; clutter re-spaced along the table |
| Fixed camera | eye (1.07, 0.42, 0.50), ~0.75 m from the targets | eye (1.15, 0.32, 0.64), 0.85–0.95 m: all five items in view. Tripod legs turned away from the table |

The 0.45 m board now has a board above it. With that board at 0.85 m (0.38 m clear), 2 of 4 episodes had no
collision-free carry onto 0.45 (once each target); at 0.95 m (0.48 m clear), 3 episodes: **mustard 3/3, tomato can
3/3**, with placements on both the 0.05 and the 0.45 board. The wrist camera's look pose is unchanged; it sees the
0.05 and 0.45 boards, not the ones above.

### D-042
**Prompt the robot from a web page** (`ui/prompt_ui.py`, `detect_node ~/set_prompt`, [ROS.md](ROS.md#prompt-ui)), so the
demo shows the prompt going in. The user's phrase or example image drives detection; the robot can still only pick
what it has a mesh for (FoundationPose is model-based), so the prompt is split into two questions:

| Question | Answered by |
|---|---|
| Which object is meant? | The user's prompt: its best YOLOE detection in the live frame. Its mask is what FoundationPose gets during the task |
| What is it (which mesh)? | The library: each target found by its stored example image + text check (the measured `Detect`, D-025). The target whose mask overlaps the prompt's (IoU > 0.5) |

Not the text check alone: it calls the lying tomato can a "bottle" (0.54, no "tomato soup can" at all), so it accepted
"the rubik's cube" as the mustard bottle and rejected "the red can". Example images are also tried padded (the object
100 and 160 px across on a 640 × 480 canvas): tight crops, where the object fills the image, matched weakly or not
at all (mustard 0.37 → 0.63, tomato can nothing → 0.58). Web page, not a desktop window: the user works from a laptop.

### D-043
**One FoundationPose instance, the mesh loaded per request** (supersedes the one-instance-per-target part of
[D-016](#d-016)). The refine and score networks don't depend on the object; only the mesh does. One instance takes
6.4 GB of VRAM, so one per object would need ~32 GB for five. `pose_node` sets `/ppp/fp/foundationpose`
`mesh_file_path` before each request (the node reloads it) and serialises requests; topics lose the `<target>` level
(`/ppp/fp/{image, ..., output}`). Mesh switch + pose: 1.3–2.2 s.

With that, **every table object with a mesh is a target** (`config.yaml objects`, which the launch files read): mustard
bottle, tomato can, Rubik's cube, sugar box, foam brick. The three new ones got stored example images in
`data/cell_refs/` (the cell's fixed-camera frame + a box): crops of the rendered objects matched weakly. First poses,
all five, within 5 mm of where the sim placed them. Whole cell, 12 GB of VRAM (sim 4.2, FoundationPose 6.4, YOLOE 1.2).

### D-044
**Installation: `scripts/install.sh` for development, Docker for deployment.** The script does every step, sudo apt
included (driver, ROS 2 + MoveIt packages, Docker + NVIDIA Container Toolkit, `.venv`, `.venv-sim`, meshes and weights,
the FoundationPose image and engines, the ROS build), skips what is done, and runs one step when named. Development
stays native: code is edited and run in place, with no image rebuilds. For deployment, `docker/Dockerfile` bakes it all
in: the `app` stage runs the same script's steps on Ubuntu 24.04, the `foundationpose` stage adds the meshes to the
Isaac ROS image (whose `isaac_ros` stage is also development's FoundationPose image), and `docker/compose.yaml` runs sim,
FoundationPose, robot and UI on the host network. Both images keep the repo at `/opt/ppp`: FoundationPose is handed mesh
paths. The TensorRT engines are built on first start into a volume, since they are specific to the GPU.

### D-045
**Demo GIF from two recordings on one clock.** The sim runs headless, so `ros_cell.py --record DIR` adds a camera at a
demo view (`config.yaml sim.record`: table, arm and whole pantry) and writes its frames as JPEGs named by wall time (a
writer thread keeps the sim loop to a copy). `scripts/record_demo.py` drives the prompt UI in headless Chrome
(Playwright: a text prompt, then an example image) and records the page; `scripts/demo_gif.py` puts both on the page
video's timeline (UI on top, sim below), speeds it up and writes GIFs with a palette per clip. Not the livestream: it
stalls Replicator annotators ([D-032](#d-032)), and a screen recording of the WebRTC client would need the laptop.

### D-046
**Variable-speed demo GIF.** One speed for the whole clip ([D-045](#d-045)) can't fit two picks into 20–30 s while the
prompting stays readable: at 4× the typing and the image choice flash past, and the clip is still ~45 s.
`demo_gif.py --motion-speed N` cuts the clip at the `events.json` marks: the prompting (page load, typing or choosing the
image, and `--hold` s after Go for the detection) runs at `--prompt-speed` (1.5×), each task at N. The corner badge shows
the current speed. Plain `--speeds` still makes the uniform GIFs. The sim now goes on top and the UI below, and
`--colors` / `--dither` shrink the file: a 26 s GIF is 30 MB at the defaults, 8.9 MB at `--width 640 --colors 64
--dither none`.

### D-047
**Two README GIFs at 1280 px.** At 640 px the 1600×780 UI recording is scaled to 0.4×, so the prompt text, the Text /
Image tabs and the "Found" line can't be read on GitHub, and the text vs. visual prompting isn't visible. One GIF at
1280 px was 31–42 MB (the fast sim motion is most of the bytes); 960 px was 13.5 MB and only just readable.
`demo_gif.py --split` cuts the same recording after the text prompt's task into `docs/demo_text.gif` and
`docs/demo_image.gif`, each under its own heading in the README (visual prompt first); at `--width 1280 --colors 48 --fps 8 --dither none` (the sim at its
native width, the UI at 0.8×) they are 10.3 and 11.1 MB. Supersedes the single GIF of [D-046](#d-046).
Text prompt first again, in recording order: the visual-prompt clip opens on the end of the text pick.

### I-001
Python fails with errors ordinary code can't produce: `unknown opcode`, `invalid SRE code`, a bogus
`UnboundLocalError`, `SystemError: error return without exception set`, segfaults. Seen in the host
`.venv` and in ~5 of 10 FoundationPose container runs (2026-09-29). Retries pass. Both environments are
affected, which points to hardware (RAM). **Action:** run memtest86+ overnight before long-running ROS
processes (Phase 3).

### I-002
With `omni.kit.livestream.app` enabled, `rep.orchestrator.step()` and annotator `get_data()` never return.
**Workaround:** D-006 (streaming mode saves nothing).

### I-003
`apps/isaacsim.exp.full.streaming.kit` started, then hung before the scene was built (crash report after
~145 s). **Workaround:** default headless app + `enable_extension('omni.kit.livestream.app')`.

### I-004
6.1 moved `isaacsim.core.api` / `core.prims` to `extsDeprecated/` (they still import), and
`isaacsim.robot.manipulators.examples` (the `Franka` class) isn't loaded. **Fix:** reference
`/Isaac/Robots/FrankaRobotics/FrankaPanda/franka.usd` directly and wrap it in `SingleArticulation`.

### I-005
Setting joint positions alone left the drives targeting zero, so the arm sagged. **Fix:** also set the
drive targets (`apply_action(ArticulationAction(...))`).

### I-006
USD material colours are **linear**; sRGB values used as-is render much paler (0.42 → looks ~0.68), and
auto-exposure hides lighting changes. **Fix:** `sim.colors` is sRGB, converted in code (`** 2.2`).

### I-007
The stream's event tracing (`primaryStream.enableEventTracing = true` by default) wrote trace files to
the working directory. **Fix:** disabled via carb setting before enabling the extension, plus a
`.gitignore` backstop. Not yet confirmed with a client connected.

### I-008
Isaac ROS 4.6 and 5.0 need driver 595+ / CUDA 13.2+. **Workaround:** pin 4.5 (D-012). Upgrading the
driver would need a reboot and re-testing Isaac Sim and the FoundationPose container.

### I-009
The existing `foundationpose` image uses conda Python 3.8 with no ROS; Jazzy's `rclpy` is Python 3.12.
**Resolved by** D-012. The container remains useful for the offline stage 2 playground.

### I-010
Our topics publish depth as `16UC1` millimetres (like `realsense2_camera`). If Isaac ROS FoundationPose
expects `32FC1` metres, insert a converter node (e.g. `isaac_ros_depth_image_proc`). Verify in Phase 0/3.
**Resolved:** the 4.5 node accepts `32FC1` and `mono16`; `detect_node` sends FoundationPose `32FC1` metres
(`fp_depth_encoding`), the cameras keep publishing `16UC1` mm.

### I-011
Installing `ros-jazzy-isaac-ros-foundationpose` inside the Isaac ROS container fails on GL/EGL libraries
that the NVIDIA toolkit bind-mounts. **Known fix:** `dpkg-divert` the conflicting files first
([NVIDIA forum](https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/cant-install-ros-jazzy-isaac-ros-foundationpose-in-isaac-ros-environment/370217)).
**Resolved by** [D-022](#d-022): installed at image build time, where the bind mounts don't exist.

### I-012
`detect_node` / `grasp_node` / `place_node` need `rclpy` (system Python 3.12) and torch / ultralytics
(from `.venv`). **Plan:** a ROS-aware venv (e.g. `--system-site-packages` with Jazzy sourced), set up in
Phase 0.
**Resolved by** [D-029](#d-029).

### I-013
Isaac's ROS camera publishers are built on Replicator, the same path that hangs while streaming
(I-002). Expect to use Foxglove instead of the WebRTC stream while ROS runs (D-017).
**Resolved (2026-09-30):** it doesn't happen. With `ros_cell.py --livestream` both cameras still publish at
~9 Hz (10 Hz target) at real-time factor 1. The ROS camera path doesn't block the way `scene.py`'s
`orchestrator.step()` / `get_data()` do. See [D-032](#d-032). (`ros2 topic hz` on the raw images showed ~1 Hz: that
is the Python CLI deserialising 1280×720 images, not the sim. Count with `raw=True` instead.)

### I-014
The scene has a tomato can on the table (a demo target) **and** one on shelf level 1 (stage 5 obstacle).
Ground-truth masks are fine (shelf items are labelled `shelf_<name>`), but at runtime YOLOE will detect
both. **Plan:** `detect_node` keeps only detections inside the table workspace (stage 3's table plane +
bounds). Alternatively, swap the shelf item for a different object.
**Resolved by** [D-021](#d-021): the shelf item was swapped for a foam brick.

### I-015
All sim results so far use perfect depth and exact masks. **Plan (Phase 5):** RealSense-like depth
noise, YOLOE masks instead of ground truth, and randomised episodes.

### I-016
FoundationPose gives slightly different results on the same frame across runs (~0.4–0.9° on one mustard
frame). Compare methods over several frames and runs, not single numbers.

### I-017
Isaac's Franka is a Panda; newer real robots are FR3 (slightly different kinematics). **Accepted** by
D-013: not deploying to hardware.

### I-018
Until hand-eye calibration exists, the extrinsics fed to the pipeline come from the sim's ground truth
(`T_base_cam.txt`), marked as a stand-in in the calibration file. It must be replaced in Phase 5 by:
eye-to-hand calibration for the fixed camera, and eye-in-hand (panda_hand → wrist camera) for the wrist
camera. Score both against ground truth.

### I-019
While the fingers squeeze an object, Isaac reports `panda_finger_joint1` velocity ≈ −0.06 m/s at constant position,
so `GripperActionController`'s stall check never fires and the close never returns. **Workaround:** the BT's
`Gripper` node treats "finger position unchanged for 0.5 s (sim time)" as done and leaves the goal active (the
fingers keep squeezing). `wait_settled` also judges rest by position, not velocity.

### I-020
`isaacsim.ros2.control`'s URDF synthesis (6.1) leaves out the Franka's fixed `panda_link7 → panda_hand` joint: two
root links, and the controller_manager rejects the URDF. **Workaround:** `sim/ros_cell.py` re-adds missing fixed
joints, posed from the USD, and calls the backend's `setup_cm` itself. Also: `panda_finger_joint2` is exported as a
mimic joint (state only), so the hand controller commands `panda_finger_joint1` only.

### I-021
The in-process controller_manager's pluginlib also finds Isaac's bundled `sdformat_urdf` parser plugin, whose
`libtinyxml2.so.9` exists only in Isaac's `jazzy/lib`. The extension sets `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` at runtime, too late for
the loader. **Workaround:** `sim/ros_cell.py` re-executes itself once with Jazzy sourced and Isaac's ROS library
directories appended (marker variable, since `.bashrc` already sources Jazzy).

### I-022
`ppp_geometry_py` built against Ubuntu's pybind11 2.11 segfaults on the first call from the `.venv` (numpy 2.5).
**Fix:** build with the `.venv`'s pybind11 3 (supports numpy 1 and 2): `ros2/build.sh`.

### I-023
With `ros2/install` sourced, pytest autoloads ROS's `launch_testing` plugins, which fail with the `.venv`'s pytest.
**Fix:** `pytest.ini` disables them.

### I-024
Live Isaac ROS FoundationPose returned the mustard bottle rotated ~180° about its long axis in several estimates
(axis within 1.4°, translation ~1 mm); other runs were right (1.35°). The bottle is nearly front/back symmetric.
Harmless here: the grasp model is its bounding box and it is placed upright. `eval_node` reports the raw error.

### I-025
The visual prompt (a crop of the real BOP image) scores the lookalike potted meat can about as high as the tomato
can in sim renders. **Mitigated by** [D-025](#d-025). Better prompts (more views, sim-domain examples) remain open.
**2026-09-30, new layout:** the potted meat can scored 0.46 (visual) against the real can's 0.26, and the text model
called the lying can a "bottle"; the fused check let the wrong one through in two runs. The potted meat can was removed
from the scene (D-035). Better prompts (more views, sim-domain examples) remain open.

### I-026
Restarting `sim/ros_cell.py` restarts sim time at 0; Python nodes keep TF from the old run ("extrapolation into
the past"). **Workaround:** restart the ROS launch after restarting the sim (docs/ROS.md).

### I-027
The mustard bottle can only be grasped across its 58 mm side (the 95 mm side doesn't fit the hand), and only from
the side if it is to go into the shelf. At some random yaws those faces point at the sugar box / Rubik's cube, and
the hand (20 cm across) can't get in without hitting them: no plan, the task fails cleanly. **Plan:** regrasp
(set it down turned, grasp again), or push it clear first. 2026-09-30, 8 episodes: mustard 3/8, can 6/8.

### I-028
Integration details, all fixed: MoveIt's Panda SRDF has a floating virtual joint `world → panda_link0` (static TF
added in `robot.launch.py`; Cartesian paths failed without it); PhysX lets a joint pressed against its limit overshoot
by a hair and MoveIt refuses such a start state (the task clamps the start state into bounds); motions were planned
while the arm was still settling (`wait_settled` before each plan).

### I-029
Objects slipped out between the table and the shelf (the task noticed at the shelf: fingers closed on nothing).
Three causes, three fixes: `GripperActionController` sets the finger command to the current position when it
detects a stall, which takes the squeeze off (its stall detection fires only now and then in Isaac, I-019), so
`allow_stalling: false` and the goal keeps squeezing; the finger pads got rubber-like friction 2.0 (was 1.0); the
arm moves at 20 % speed while carrying. Also, the items on the shelf were real in the sim but unknown to MoveIt, so
motions into the shelf swept the held object through them: `place_node` now returns what isn't a support
(minus the boards' own edges, already modelled) and it goes into the planning scene as voxels (`shelf_clutter`).

### I-030
Restarting the sim with `--livestream` without stopping the first one left two sims running, both publishing
`/clock` (sim time jumping between ~53 s and ~1336 s) and running their own `controller_manager`. Every node
logged `TF_OLD_DATA`, and MoveIt and the task couldn't run. **Fix:** `ros_cell.py` now exits at start if
`/clock` already has a publisher. Restarting the sim still needs step 2 restarted too (I-026).

### I-031
The task scanned the shelf, then every move failed (`unknown goal response`, `Execute request aborted`,
`execution to home failed`, 0/2 placed). A second copy of step 2 (`robot`, `moveit` and `perception` launches,
reparented to init) was still running from an earlier session, along with two `gt_pose_stub.py` scratch
publishers. Two `move_group`s answered the same `/move_action` goal. **Workaround:** before step 2, check that
`ros2 node list | sort | uniq -d` prints nothing, and stop leftovers with `pgrep -af "ros2 launch|move_group"`.

### I-032
MoveIt's KDL plugin, asked for a side pregrasp of the mustard from a home seed, returned configurations 6.2 / 10.3 /
11.3 rad (summed) from home; a least-squares IK from the same seed finds one 3.3 rad away. The task then moved
through those. **Fix:** pick_ik + chained seeds + joint targets (D-037).

### I-033
Pilz checks a PTP trajectory at its fixed sample times, several cm apart at the hand; OMPL's default
`longest_valid_segment_fraction` (0.005) is ~8 cm there. The held object was seen hitting the shelf. **Fix:**
the task checks every straight line every 0.02 rad; OMPL's fraction is 0.0005 (D-037).

### I-034
With 140 N, `panda_finger_joint2` (mimic) ended up to 8 mm off `panda_finger_joint1`, so 2 × joint1 read the tomato can
(67 mm) as 49 mm. **Fix:** the grip is joint1 + joint2; 64 articulation iterations. Light objects still read a few mm
narrower than they are.

### I-035
"Two straight lines through home" planned both legs up front; after the first the arm stopped 0.02 rad off home at
joint 5 and MoveIt rejected the second (`start point deviates from current robot state`). **Fix:** the second leg is
planned from the actual state after the first.

### I-036
`ros-jazzy-pick-ik` is in apt but installing needs sudo. For validation it was built from source (with range-v3) in
`third_party/pick_ik_ws/` (gitignored) and sourced before `ros2/install`. **Resolved:** `ros-jazzy-pick-ik` installed
from apt, the source build deleted. (Without either, every IK request fails: both picks failed in a run in between.)

### I-037
Episode 0 (D-037 batch): the task placed the can upright at (0.32, −0.66) on the top board, 20 cm from its open
right end, and reported PLACED; ground truth then had it lying off the shelf. Probably knocked while the fingers
backed out (`depart` is only partly feasible near the reach limit). Not yet reproduced.

### I-038
The pose overlay ([D-034](#d-034)) draws lines into the Isaac scene, and the cameras render them like any other object,
which can spoil detections. **Workaround:** `ros_cell.py --overlay`, off by default, for watching and recording only.

### I-039
Five targets instead of two: in the first episode the sugar box (4th) was picked, but every carry path to its
placement collided with objects already on the shelf (`held_sugar_box-shelf_clutter`), and the task gave it up.
3 episodes, all five targets ([D-043](#d-043)): **10/15 placed** (mustard 2/3, tomato can 2/3, Rubik's cube 3/3,
sugar box 1/3, foam brick 2/3; the task's own verdict agreed with ground truth 15/15). All five failures are motion:
"no plan to joint target" with the held object hitting boards or objects already on the shelf, and one aborted
execution. Every object was detected and posed in every episode.

### I-040
`~/set_prompt` takes a text prompt's best detection whatever its score. With all five objects as targets,
"the rubik's cube" found the foam brick at 0.06, and the library confirmed it (the brick is a target), so the robot
would have picked the wrong object. "The colorful cube" (0.48) and "the red block" (0.69) found the cube. A score floor
would stop this, but "the mustard" was right at 0.05; needs a decision (floor, or ask the user to confirm low scores).

### I-041
In `docker compose up`, `depends_on` only orders container starts. The sim took ~160 s after a reboot to bring up its
controller_manager, and robot's spawner gives up after 120 s, so the arm and hand controllers never loaded: the first
prompt's grasp closed on nothing and the arm ended in self-collision. Development never hits it because the sim is
started first. Fix: the `sim` service has a healthcheck (`/controller_manager/list_controllers` is served) and `robot`
waits for `service_healthy`. Then loading still failed: `parameters=` on the spawner makes launch write a params file to
robot's `/tmp`, and the spawner hands its path to the controller_manager, which runs in the sim container. The spawner now
takes `use_sim_time` as a ROS argument. With both fixes a text-prompted mustard pick placed 1/1 through compose.
