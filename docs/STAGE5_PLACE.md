# Stage 5 — Shelf placement playground

## Commands

Cursor terminal on the workstation, host `.venv` (numpy + OpenCV only). Needs `data/sim/shelf/` — make it once with the sim:

```bash
.venv-sim/bin/python sim/scene.py                                                   # Isaac Sim: writes data/sim/shelf/ (~15 s)
source .venv/bin/activate                                                           # once per terminal
python pipeline/interactive_place.py                                                # where does the mustard bottle fit?
python pipeline/interactive_place.py --object 005_tomato_soup_can --tag soup        # a smaller object
python pipeline/interactive_place.py --hand-clearance 0.15 --tag bighand            # a bulkier hand above the object
python pipeline/interactive_place.py --margin 0.04 --tag margin                     # keep 4 cm from everything
python pipeline/interactive_place.py --help
```
Prints supports + candidates, saves `output/place/<tag>.png` (3 panels), opens it as a Cursor tab.

## Data

The shelf in the Isaac Sim cell ([SIM.md](SIM.md)), seen by a **wrist camera**: the arm moves to a "look at the shelf" pose and the camera on its hand takes the picture.

| Data | File |
|---|---|
| RGB image | `data/sim/shelf/rgb/000000.png` (only for drawing) |
| Depth | `data/sim/shelf/depth/000000.png` (uint16 mm) |
| Camera intrinsics `K` | `data/sim/shelf/cam_K.txt` |
| Camera pose in the robot base `T_base_cam` | `data/sim/shelf/T_base_cam.txt` — on a real robot: joint angles (forward kinematics) + hand-eye calibration. **Gives "up"** |
| Object to place | `assets/ycb/<--object>/textured.obj` → footprint radius + height (placed upright) |
| Ground truth (only for checking) | `data/sim/shelf/shelf.json`: board heights 0.05 / 0.45 m |
| **Supports, free space, candidates** | terminal + `output/place/<tag>.png` |

No shelf model is used: every horizontal surface the camera sees is a possible place to put things.

## Knobs

Defaults: `config.yaml` → `place:`. Flags override per run.

| Knob | Flag | What it does | Default |
|---|---|---|---|
| `max_tilt_deg` | — | A surface is "horizontal" if its normal is within this of up | 10° |
| `ransac_dist` | `--ransac-dist` | Point-to-plane distance that counts as "on the surface" | 8 mm |
| `min_inliers` / `min_area` | — | Smaller planes / pieces are ignored | 800 pts / 0.01 m² |
| `resolution` | `--resolution` | Grid cell size | 1 cm |
| `height_thresh` | `--height-thresh` | Higher than this above a support = obstacle | 12 mm |
| `margin` | `--margin` | Free space kept around the object's footprint | 1 cm |
| `hand_clearance` | `--hand-clearance` | Space needed above the object for the hand while setting it down | 8 cm |
| `max_reach` | `--max-reach` | Place point must be this close to the Franka shoulder (0, 0, 0.333) | 0.85 m |
| `per_support` | — | Best candidates kept per support | 3 |

## Outputs

| Output | Where |
|---|---|
| Points, planes → supports, time | terminal |
| Object footprint radius, height, headroom it needs | terminal |
| Per support: height (+ nearest ground-truth board), area, free / occupied / unknown cells, headroom, largest free circle, candidates (or "out of reach") | terminal |
| Per candidate: place point in the **base** frame, clearance, headroom, reach, same point in the **camera** frame | terminal |
| A: every support tinted + its height | `output/place/<tag>.png` top left |
| B: free / occupied / unknown drawn on each reachable support + candidate footprints (magenta = best) | top right |
| C: each reachable support from above, oriented like the camera view (back of the shelf at the top) | bottom |

## How it works

```
depth + up ─► points + normals ─► horizontal points ─► sequential RANSAC ─► planes ─► split into pieces (supports)
          ─► per support: ceiling, free / occupied / unknown, clearance ─► slide the object's footprint ─► candidates
```

| Step | What happens | Here |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Points + up | Depth → 3D points, moved into the robot base frame (z = up) with `T_base_cam` | 307k points |
| 2. Normals | Surface direction at each pixel from its neighbours (±3 px). Keep points facing up (within 10°) | 233k |
| 3. Planes | RANSAC on those points: biggest horizontal plane, remove it, repeat (sequential RANSAC) | 4 planes |
| 4. Supports | Each plane cut into connected pieces on a 1 cm grid: one shelf level, the floor... | 6 supports |
| 5. Ceiling | The lowest support above that overlaps this one = its ceiling. Headroom = ceiling − height | 400 mm on the bottom board; top board: open |
| 6. Cells | Like stage 3: **free** (only support points), **occupied** (≥ 3 points between the support and its ceiling), **unknown** (not seen) | — |
| 7. Candidates | Clearance = distance to the nearest non-free cell. A cell fits if clearance ≥ footprint radius and headroom ≥ object height + hand. Best first, no overlaps | 6 |

**Result for the mustard bottle** (radius 59 mm incl. margin, 191 mm tall → needs 271 mm headroom):

| Support | Height (GT) | Headroom | Candidates | Note |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| S0–S3 | −0.75 (floor) | open | out of reach | seen past and under the shelf |
| S4 | 0.050 (0.05) | 400 mm | 3 | bottom board, around the sugar box and Rubik's cube; the back is hidden under the top board |
| S5 | 0.450 (0.45) | open | 3 | top board, either side of the foam brick: most room (150 mm) → **best** |

Both board heights match the ground truth to the millimetre.

## Things to try

| Try | Question |
|---|---|
| `--object 005_tomato_soup_can` | Smaller and shorter: where does it fit that the bottle doesn't? |
| `--hand-clearance 0.15` | Only the top board is left. How much hand room do the lower levels really have? |
| `--margin 0.04` | Which levels are too crowded now? |
| `--resolution 0.02` | Coarser grid: do candidates move? |
| Panel C of the bottom level | Why is the back half missing? (Where could the camera go to see it?) |

## Gotchas

- **"Up" comes from the robot, not the image.** `T_base_cam` from the arm's joint angles tells which way gravity points; without it, you'd infer up from the scene (e.g. the direction most surfaces share).
- **Only what the camera sees can be offered.** The back of the bottom board is hidden under the top one; it never becomes a candidate. More views (move the wrist camera) would fix that.
- **Headroom is measured to the top of the board above.** We only see board tops, so headroom includes the board's own thickness (400 mm measured, 380 mm real). Keep `hand_clearance` generous.
- **No IK / path check.** "Within reach" is a distance, not a motion plan; placing on the bottom board means reaching in under the top one.
- **Upright only, round footprint.** The playground models the object as a cylinder around its upright footprint, so any
  yaw fits. The ROS `place_node` also offers the other stable rest poses of the mesh ([D-031](DECISIONS.md#d-031)).
