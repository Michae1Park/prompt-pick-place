# prompt-pick-place

**Vision-driven pick-and-place from a prompt.** Show the robot one example image (or type a phrase), and it
finds that object on the table, estimates its 6-DoF pose, plans a grasp, and finds free space on a shelf to
put it — with no object-specific training and no prior model of the shelf.

*Simulated cell (Isaac Sim 6.1): Franka Panda with lengthened fingers, a table of YCB objects, a metal pantry as the
place target, a fixed RealSense D455 over the table, and a wrist-mounted D455 that looks into the shelf.*

*Demo: a text prompt, then an example image, from the [Prompt UI](#terminal-3-option-a--web-page). Prompting at 1.5×,
robot motion at 8×.*

## Pipeline

![Pipeline: the prompt and two RGB-D cameras feed five stages (detect, pose, table, grasp, place); a grasp and a placement are chosen together, and the task manager executes the pick and the place with MoveIt 2](docs/pipeline.svg)

Guide: [docs/ROS.md](docs/ROS.md). A web page prompts the robot with a phrase or an example image and shows what it saw
and what it is doing: [Prompt UI](#terminal-3-option-a--web-page).

| Stage | Question it answers | Method | Runs as |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 **Detect** | Where is the object I was shown? | YOLOE-seg, visual or text prompt → box + mask | Python node |
| 2 **Pose** | What is its exact 6-DoF pose? | FoundationPose (model-based, mask-initialised) | Isaac ROS, TensorRT, Docker |
| 3 **Table** | Where is the table, and what is free? | RANSAC plane + occupancy grid | C++ node |
| 4 **Grasp** | How should the gripper take it? | Parallel-jaw candidates + tilt / table / collision filter | Python node |
| 5 **Place** | Where on the shelf does it fit? | Sequential RANSAC for horizontal supports + free-space search | Python node, C++ RANSAC |
| **Choose together** | Which grasp suits which shelf spot? | The arm looks at the shelf before it picks; placements (upright first) are paired with grasps (least tilted first) | Task manager (BehaviorTree.CPP) |
| **Pick → Place** | How does the arm get there cleanly? | IK chained from one natural arm configuration (pick_ik); straight joint-space moves, else via home, STOMP or RRTConnect; the held object is part of the robot for collision checking | MoveIt 2 (pick_ik, Pilz, OMPL), ros2_control in Isaac Sim |

## Requirements

| | Minimum | Tested |
|---|---|---|
| OS | Ubuntu 24.04 | 24.04.3 |
| GPU | NVIDIA RTX, 16 GB VRAM | L40S, 46 GB |
| Driver | 580 or newer (the install script sets it up) | 580.173 |
| RAM | 32 GB | 64 GB |
| CPU | 8 cores | i9-14900K |
| Disk | 200 GB free | |
| Download | ~100 GB on first install | |

The whole task uses 12 GB of VRAM and 18 GB of RAM.

## Install

**Development (native).** One script, on the workstation:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Michae1Park/prompt-pick-place.git
cd prompt-pick-place
scripts/install.sh
```

It asks for your sudo password, skips anything already installed and can be re-run at any point. Each step on its
own: `scripts/install.sh <step> [<step> ...]`.

| Step | Installs | First time |
|---|---|---|
| `driver` | NVIDIA driver 580 if missing or older. **Then reboot and run the script again** | 5 min |
| `apt` | Build tools, git-lfs, Python venv | 1 min |
| `ros` | ROS 2 Jazzy, MoveIt 2, pick_ik, ros2_control, BehaviorTree.CPP, vision_msgs, foxglove_bridge | 5 min |
| `docker` | Docker Engine + NVIDIA Container Toolkit; adds you to the `docker` group (**log out and in** afterwards) | 3 min |
| `venv` | `.venv`: PyTorch (CUDA 13.0), ultralytics (YOLOE), OpenCV, pybind11 | 5 min |
| `sim` | `.venv-sim`: Isaac Sim 6.1 | 15 min |
| `assets` | YCB meshes (`assets/ycb/`), YOLOE weights (`models/`) | 2 min |
| `fp` | FoundationPose image `ppp-isaac-ros:4.5`, its ONNX models and TensorRT engines for your GPU | 30 min |
| `build` | ROS workspace (`ros2/build.sh`), camera extrinsics | 3 min |

Installing accepts the [NVIDIA Omniverse EULA](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/platform/latest/common/NVIDIA_Omniverse_License_Agreement.html)
(Isaac Sim) and NVIDIA's model license (FoundationPose weights, from NGC).

After changing code: C++, messages or launch files → `ros2/build.sh`; Python → nothing (symlinked).

**Deployment (Docker).** The code and all its dependencies are baked into two images, so the workstation needs only
the NVIDIA driver and Docker.

**1 · Install the driver and Docker** (after cloning the repo as above):

```bash
scripts/install.sh driver docker
```

Reboot if it installed the driver, and log out and in after the Docker step.

**2 · Build**, from the repo root (~1 h the first time; again after every code change):

```bash
docker compose -f docker/compose.yaml build
```

**3 · Run: option A *or* option B**, never both (they drive the same arm). Same options as in
[Run the robot](#run-the-robot).

*Option A · Prompt UI.* Starts the sim, robot, FoundationPose and the prompt UI; then open **http://localhost:8088**.

```bash
docker compose -f docker/compose.yaml up
```

*Option B · Scripted.* Starts the same without the UI; once it is ready, a second terminal runs the task. It picks
every target one after the other, prints a summary and exits.

```bash
docker compose -f docker/compose.yaml up robot       # terminal 1
docker compose -f docker/compose.yaml run --rm task  # terminal 2, once terminal 1 is ready
```

| Good to know | |
|---|---|
| **Sim viewport** | Put `SIM_ARGS=--livestream` in front of `up` (either option), e.g. `SIM_ARGS=--livestream docker compose -f docker/compose.yaml up`, then connect as [below](#sim-viewport-livestream-webrtc) |
| **First start** | ~2 min to build the TensorRT engines and a few more for Isaac Sim's shaders. Both are kept in Docker volumes, so later starts are fast |
| **Changing code** | Every change needs an image rebuild (step 2), which is slow. Develop natively; use Docker to deploy |

## Vision playgrounds (each stage on its own)

**Not part of the robot pipeline.** Each command runs one vision algorithm by itself on a stored RGB-D scene: no
sim, no ROS, no robot. Use them to try a stage, tune its parameters in `config.yaml`, or debug it. Each prints a
report and writes an annotated image to `output/`.

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
python pipeline/interactive_detect.py --ref 006_mustard_bottle     # 1 detect
python pipeline/interactive_pose.py                                 # 2 pose (needs the NVlabs container, below)
python pipeline/interactive_spatial.py                              # 3 table + free space
python pipeline/interactive_grasp.py                                # 4 grasp
python pipeline/interactive_place.py                                # 5 place (needs the sim capture below)
.venv-sim/bin/python sim/scene.py                                   # Isaac Sim: RGB-D + ground truth -> data/sim/
```

Stage 2's playground runs NVlabs' research FoundationPose in a container named `foundationpose` that
`scripts/install.sh` does not set up yet; the robot uses Isaac ROS FoundationPose instead and doesn't need it.

## Run the robot

Three terminals, **all on the workstation**, each starting from the repo root (`cd ~/workspace/prompt-pick-place`).
Install first: [Install](#install).

| Terminal | Starts | Ready when it prints |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Isaac Sim cell (robot, table, cameras) | `[ros_cell] running` |
| 2 | Robot drivers, MoveIt, perception | `[detect_node]: ready`, then ~1 min for FoundationPose's TensorRT engines |
| 3 | **What the robot does: option A *or* option B** (never both: they drive the same arm) | — |

Terminal 3, the two options:

| | Option A · web page (demo) | Option B · scripted |
|---|---|---|
| You | Type a phrase or drop an example image, press **Pick it up** | Nothing: it starts at once |
| Robot | Picks the prompted object, one per prompt; waits for the next | Picks each target, prints a summary, exits |
| Stop | Ctrl+C (or **Stop** on the page) | Ctrl+C |

### Terminal 1 · sim

```bash
cd ~/workspace/prompt-pick-place
.venv-sim/bin/python sim/ros_cell.py
```

To watch the sim's viewport from a laptop, add `--livestream` ([below](#sim-viewport-livestream-webrtc)).

### Terminal 2 · robot, MoveIt, perception

```bash
cd ~/workspace/prompt-pick-place
source ros2/install/setup.bash && ros2 launch ppp_bringup all.launch.py eval:=true
```

The robot stays still until terminal 3 gives it a task.

### Terminal 3, option A · web page

```bash
cd ~/workspace/prompt-pick-place
source ros2/install/setup.bash && .venv/bin/python ui/prompt_ui.py
```

Then open **http://localhost:8088** (from a laptop: [below](#prompt-ui-in-the-laptops-browser)).

![Prompt UI: text or image prompt, task steps, live fixed and wrist cameras, and what the robot detected](docs/ui/prompt_ui.png)

*The **Prompt UI**: type a phrase or drop an example image on the left,
follow the task's steps at the top right, and watch the fixed and wrist cameras live, with what the robot detected, at
the bottom.*

| Control | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Text** tab | A phrase, e.g. "the yellow bottle" or "the red can" |
| **Image** tab | Drop an example image or pick a sample (`assets/prompts/`), then drag a box around the object (default: the whole image) |
| **Pick it up** | Finds the prompted object, then picks it and places it on the shelf |
| **Stop** · **Reset scene** · **Forget prompts** | Stop the task · re-drop the table objects · go back to the stored example images |

Options: `--port` (default 8088), `--camera` / `--wrist-camera` (image topics). Details:
[Prompt UI](docs/ROS.md#prompt-ui).

### Terminal 3, option B · scripted

```bash
cd ~/workspace/prompt-pick-place
source ros2/install/setup.bash && ros2 launch ppp_bringup task.launch.py   # every target, one after the other
```

One target only: `ros2 launch ppp_bringup task.launch.py targets:='[tomato_soup_can]'`.

**Pitfalls.** Run one sim at a time. After restarting the sim (terminal 1), restart terminal 2 too: running nodes
keep the old sim time.

## Watching from another machine

Everything runs on the workstation; a laptop only views it. The workstation's IP (run on the workstation):

```bash
hostname -I | awk '{print $1}'        # e.g. 192.168.33.118 -> <workstation-ip> below
```

**Ports (on the workstation):**

- **Prompt UI:** TCP 8088
- **Foxglove:** TCP 8765
- **Sim livestream:** TCP 49100 + UDP 47998. UDP can't go through an SSH tunnel: the laptop must be on the same LAN or a VPN

### Prompt UI in the laptop's browser

| How you reach the workstation | Open in the laptop's browser |
|---|---|
| Same network | `http://<workstation-ip>:8088` |
| Cursor / VS Code Remote-SSH | `http://localhost:8088` (the editor forwards the port by itself: Ports tab) |
| Plain SSH | First, on the laptop: `ssh -L 8088:localhost:8088 <user>@<workstation-ip>`; then `http://localhost:8088` |

### Sim viewport: livestream (WebRTC)

**1 · Laptop, once:** download the **Isaac Sim WebRTC Streaming Client** for your OS from the
[Isaac Sim download page](https://docs.isaacsim.omniverse.nvidia.com/latest/installation/download.html) and install it.

**2 · Start the sim with streaming.** Either type it in a workstation terminal (e.g. Cursor's):

```bash
cd ~/workspace/prompt-pick-place
.venv-sim/bin/python sim/ros_cell.py --livestream
```

or start it from the laptop in one line (PowerShell or any terminal; the sim stops when this window closes):

```bash
ssh -t <user>@<workstation-ip> "cd ~/workspace/prompt-pick-place && .venv-sim/bin/python sim/ros_cell.py --livestream"
```

Wait until it prints both lines:

```text
[ros_cell] streaming on TCP 49100 / UDP 47998 - connect the Isaac Sim WebRTC Streaming Client to this machine's IP
[ros_cell] running: cameras at 10.0 Hz sim time, rtf cap 1.0. Ctrl+C to quit.
```

This is terminal 1: start terminals 2 and 3 as usual.

**3 · Laptop:** open the Streaming Client and connect:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Server | `<workstation-ip>`, e.g. `192.168.33.118`: the bare IP, no `http://`, no port |
| Ports | None to enter: the client uses TCP 49100 and UDP 47998 by itself |
| Then | **Connect**; the viewport appears in a few seconds |

**If it doesn't connect**

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| Nothing appears | The laptop must reach the workstation directly (same LAN or VPN): video is UDP, which an SSH tunnel can't carry |
| Still nothing, firewall on | On the workstation: `sudo ufw allow 49100/tcp && sudo ufw allow 47998/udp` |
| Picture freezes | Close the client and connect again; the sim keeps running. One client at a time |
| `NVST Error: NVST_R_BUSY` in the sim terminal | Connection noise from the client; harmless |

### ROS data: Foxglove

**1 · Workstation**, terminal 2 with the bridge:

```bash
cd ~/workspace/prompt-pick-place
source ros2/install/setup.bash && ros2 launch ppp_bringup all.launch.py eval:=true foxglove:=true
```

**2 · Laptop:** in [Foxglove](https://foxglove.dev/download), **Open connection → Foxglove WebSocket**, then:

| How you reach the workstation | URL |
|---|---|
| Same network | `ws://<workstation-ip>:8765` |
| Cursor / VS Code Remote-SSH | `ws://localhost:8765` (the editor forwards the port: Ports tab) |
| Plain SSH | First, on the laptop: `ssh -L 8765:localhost:8765 <user>@<workstation-ip>`; then `ws://localhost:8765` |
